# Mush Farmoatic

This is a project for my lab class of Artificial Neural Networks in Binus University Semester 4. Here we were asked to create a Self-Organising Map (SOM) to cluster the mushrooms from their physical features as well as classification of mushrooms that are edible and poisonous using python. This project was done in groups of 2.
